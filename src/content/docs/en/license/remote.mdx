The remote feature complements the [license system](../license). It allows you to manage Oxygen 3rd-party design sets with ease.

If you have a Site Key from a 3rd-party design set, you can add it to the Remote list, which will be available in the Oxygen editor.

## Adding a 3rd-party design set

### Step 1: Add new remote

Go to **Oxygen â†’ Yabe Kokoro**. Switch to the **Remotes** tab and click the **Add New** button.
